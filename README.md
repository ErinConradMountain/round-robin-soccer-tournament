# Round Robin Soccer Tournament

This small project helps record scores for a Six-A-Side soccer tournament. The app is now split into separate pages:

- **Register Teams** (`register.html`) – add teams taking part.
- **Matches** (`matches.html`) – capture match results.
- **Scoreboard** (`scoreboard.html`) – view standings and the final matchup.

Open `index.html` for links to each section. Results are stored in your browser so you can navigate between pages without losing data.
